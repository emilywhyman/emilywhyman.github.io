Hi, I'm Emily.
I'm a designer based in Barcelona - but can proudly say i'm from Yorkshire (UK).

My interest is is food, and anything to do with it. From production to consumption, this website is dedicated to discussing vital issues regarding the food system. It's also for experimentation of new and exciting methodologies of food production.

I hope you enjoy + drop me a message: whether it's about a food-related cause, or just to say hello (I don't bite).
