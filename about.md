i'm interested in food, from it's production to consumption - this website is dedicated to discussing vital issues regarding the food system. it's also for experimentation of new and exciting methodologies of food production.

i hope you enjoy + drop me a message: whether it's about a food-related cause, or just to say hello (i don't bite).
