###### how-to

<li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
<li>Add the vegan butter and brown and white sugar to an electric mixing bowl and cream together. Add the vanilla and mix in.</li>
<li>Sift the flour(s) and cocoa powder into a mixing bowl and mix in the baking soda and salt.</li>
<li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet, mixing in by hand until crumbly.</li>
<li>Add the 1 Tbsp soy milk or other non-dairy milk and mix into a thick cookie dough.</li>
<li>Add the 1 Tbsp soy milk or other non-dairy milk and mix into a thick cookie dough.</li>
<li>Add the 1 Tbsp soy milk or other non-dairy milk and mix into a thick cookie dough.</li>
<li>Add the chocolate chunks and mix in. Your cookie dough will be very thick, but sticky enough to easily roll into balls.</li>
<li>Roll into small balls and space evenly on a parchment lined baking tray.</li>
<li>Bake for 10 minutes. The edges will be firm but the cookies will still be soft in the middle. This is fine, they will firm up as they cool.</li>
<li>Press in a few more chocolate chunks to the top of the cookies as they come out of the oven if you like (optional).</li>
